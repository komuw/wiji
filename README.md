## wiji          

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/komuw/wiji/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/komuw/wiji)


`Wiji` is an async/asyncio distributed task processor/queue.       
It's name is derived from the late Kenyan hip hop artiste, Gwiji.      

It is a bit like [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery)        
 
`wiji` has no third-party dependencies and it requires python version 3.7+
  
`wiji` is work in progress and very early. It's API may change in backward incompatible ways.

## Installation

```shell
pip install wiji
```           


## Usage

#### 1. As a library
```python
import asyncio
import wiji

class AdderTask(wiji.task.Task):
    async def run(self, a, b):
        result = a + b
        print("\nresult: {0}\n".format(result))
        return result


broker = wiji.broker.InMemoryBroker()
myAdderTask = AdderTask(the_broker=broker, queue_name="AdderTaskQueue1")

# queue some tasks
myAdderTask.synchronous_delay(a=4, b=37)
myAdderTask.synchronous_delay(a=67, b=847)

# run the workers
worker = wiji.Worker(the_task=myAdderTask)
asyncio.run(worker.consume_tasks())
```

#### 2. As a cli app
`wiji` also ships with a commandline interface app called `wiji-cli`.             
                
create a `wiji` config file(which is just any python file that has a class instance of `wiji.conf.WijiConf`), eg;             
`examples/my_config.py`                 
```python
import wiji

class AdderTask(wiji.task.Task):
    async def run(self, a, b):
        res = a + b
        return res

BROKER = wiji.broker.InMemoryBroker()
myAdderTask = AdderTask(the_broker=BROKER, queue_name="AdderTaskTestQ1")

MyConfigInstance = wiji.conf.WijiConf(tasks=[myAdderTask])
```          
**NB:** the directory where your place that file(in this case; `examples/`) ought to be in your `PYTHONPATH`               
then run `wiji-cli` pointing it to the dotted path of the `wiji.conf.WijiConf` instance:     

```bash
wiji-cli --config examples.my_config.MyConfigInstance
```
