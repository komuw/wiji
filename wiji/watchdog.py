class BlockingTaskError(BlockingIOError):

    Exception raised by wiji when the main asyncio thread is blocked by either

    impact the main thread.

class BlockingWatchdog:
    """
    Monitors for any blocking calls in the main python asyncio thread.

    Python runs all asyncio operations(coroutines/tasks) on one Main thread in an evented manner.
    It is thus important that any operation you run in an asyncio environment be non-blocking.
    All your libraries(for http requests, database connections, rabbbitMQ clients etc) need to be async.
      As an example, the popular python http library/client; `python-requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ is not async(non-blocking)
      For http requests, you should consider using an async client like `aiohttp <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp>`_

    This class runs in a separate thread(away from the Main asyncio thread) so that it can monitor for any blocking calls on the Main thread.
    It does blocking detection in intervals of `watchdog_duration` seconds.
    The `watchdog_duration` is configurable and defaults to 0.1 seconds(0.1 seconds since that is also the default value in core Python.)
    We urge caution in trying to configure it to any value longer than 0.4 seconds;
      0.4s is the approximate `ping` duration(request & response) between the two farthest points on Earth for a signal travelling through copper.
      Of course, if you are doing any interstellar communication, then we urge you to consider using tools that are better suited for those
      kind of endeavours. `wiji` is not (as yet) suitable for interstellar IO communication.

    When `BlockingWatchdog` detects a blocking - IO/CPU bound - call that lasts for longer than `watchdog_duration` seconds;
    it will log an event that looks like:
        {
            "event": "wiji.BlockingWatchdog.blocked",
            "stage": "end",
            "error": "Blocked tasks Watchdog has not received any notifications in 0.1 seconds. This means the Main thread is blocked! "
            "Hint: are you running any tasks with blocking calls? eg; using python-requests? etc? "
            "Hint: look at the `stack_trace` attached to this log event to discover which calls are potentially blocking.",

    As you can see from that log event, you should as an application developer be able to identify where in your code the blocking calls are.
    When you do that, it is important you rectify them and make them async calls.
    If you do not, your task processing/execution is going to slow down considerably.

    If you buy into Python's asyncio world(which I think you should if your tasks/operations are mostly IO-bound), you should accept the fact that
    Python is running your stuff on one Thread.
    Your life will be much happier once you accept this and architect your operations with that in mind.
